# Transformer_classifier_pytorch
A notebook demonstrating use of Transformer's encoder block for multi-class classification using Pytorch only!


[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maqboolkhan/Transformer_classifier_pytorch/blob/master/Transformer_Classification_Pytorch.ipynb)

- It does not use any other library for the model (e.g. Hugging Face). Hence, only uses Pytorch.
- Transformer itself is a sequence-to-sequence model consisting of Encoder and Decoder block.
- However, in order to use Transformer for classification task we can only use Encoder block. This notebook demonstrate this!
- Notebook is heavily commented with tensor's `shape` and possible explanation of logic.
- Feel free to ask any question (raise issue) and contributions are also welcome regarding the notebook.
